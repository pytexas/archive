Or, if you've studied computer science, you probably don't need this.\n\nWe will take a look at how both of these languages work. What happens when you declare and use a variable? What about when you declare a class, instantiate a class, and call class methods?\n\nWhat real world advantages does each language have? What features does each language have that do not really exist in the other?\n\nIs Python really \"easier\" and C++ really \"harder\"?\n\n[ This can be made a short talk if that would fit better ]","level":"Beginner","stype":"Talk (50 Minutes)","slides":null,"video_url":null,"start":"2015-09-26T14:00:00Z","duration":50}
