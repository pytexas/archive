I will introduce a python framework called ryu that allows a developer to easily customize and extend OVS to route network traffic based on their needs.  I will demo a few different topologies and show the code that allows use to customize routes.  Finally I will discuss how we at Rackspace are using this framework to solve some extremely complex issues.","level":"Intermediate","stype":"Talk (50 Minutes)","slides":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHxeu7-Wb9w&index=29&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-27T16:00:00Z","duration":50}
