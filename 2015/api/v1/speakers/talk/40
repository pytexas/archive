Python is the best programming language on Earth. If you have ever wanted to get started with Python & Selenium, this is the tutorial for you. \n\nI will cover how to get started setting up a Selenium environment for development. Using Se's Python bindings, we'll launch various web browsers, navigate to sites, and interact with elements on web pages, just like a real browser. \n\nWe'll make Classes which allow us to know more about the state the browser has, commonly referred to as \"Page Objects\". Some common Selenium exceptions will be utilized to ensure our actions are in sync with the site. We'll design our Page Objects with an eye toward the future, test durability, and ease of maintainability.\n\nWe'll tackle test execution, integrating these tests in your current development life cycle (with or without a CI), troubleshooting when tests fail, and specific things to avoid while testing. \n\nWe'll touch on how Selenium Grid, which is used to run tests across multiple machines, is configured, as well service providers in this area.\n\nI hope you can join us!","level":"Beginner","stype":"Tutorial (3 Hours)","slides":null,"video_url":null,"start":"2015-09-25T14:00:00Z","duration":180}
