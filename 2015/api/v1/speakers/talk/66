However, addition of just a few lines of code to a django project using the django-secure package can pre-emptively pick much of an attackers low-hanging fruit. In this meetup, we will secure a simple website using django-secure, use the command-line tool \"checksecure\" to do a security audit, and discuss a few of the attacks django-secure protects against. In the process, we will learn how to use nginx for more robust security and discuss how to pass a security audit.","level":"Intermediate","stype":"Talk (50 Minutes)","slides":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h4om2hYL84&index=21&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-27T14:00:00Z","duration":50}
