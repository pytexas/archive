By the end, we hope you'll be able to answer the following questions:\n\n  * Why should I care about async programming at all?\n  * What is `asyncio` and how is it used?\n  * How do I use this stuff to solve real-world problems?\n\nWe'll assume some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with async programming is required. Please come with Python 3.4+ installed.\n\nAll the codez can be found in these 2 repos\n\n  * [https://github.com/eloyz/aioui](https://github.com/eloyz/aioui)  \n  * [https://github.com/jpwatts/aioserver](https://github.com/jpwatts/aioserver)  \n\n[`asyncio`]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html","level":"Beginner","stype":"Tutorial (3 Hours)","slides":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aoh_yoiEtv8&index=25&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-25T14:00:00Z","duration":180}
