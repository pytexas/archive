Whether you're deploying a web app, performing data analysis, or creating local environments for your dev team or CI builds, Docker can help.\n\nI'll give an introduction to Docker, an overview of some of the current tools in the Docker ecosystem (Docker Machine and Docker Compose) and demonstrate how to create, build, and deploy Python applications using Docker.\n\nThis talk is targeted towards web developers, data scientists, or really anyone who develops using Python that would like to learn more about Docker and how it can help their projects.","level":"Beginner","stype":"Talk (50 Minutes)","slides":"http://bit.ly/1Vi7qbG","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhabrYF1nms&index=5&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-26T19:00:00Z","duration":50}
