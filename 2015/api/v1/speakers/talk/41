When using Selenium, everything looks like a browser automation test. \n\nBrowser automated tests are your slowest tests to run, so when you don't need a web browser, you shouldn't be using Selenium.\n\nWith real world examples, this talk will cover scenarios where Selenium is commonly (mis)used, and then recommend the appropriate change in code or tool. \n\nWe'll also spend some time on some of the more esoteric features of Selenium, and demonstrate a handful of \"Stupid Selenium Tricks\" that nobody should ever need to know how to do.","level":"Intermediate","stype":"Short Talk (20 Minutes)","slides":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUVRBz6U0Uc&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX&index=14","start":"2015-09-26T14:00:00Z","duration":20}
