If you want to add a full text search engine to your Python application and effectively search large volumes of unstructured text, you could use Xapian which is an open-source, light-weight and very fast C++ library. Targeted to Python developers, this talk aims at introducing Xapian and its Python bindings along with basic search concepts. We will show how to build your search engine using Xapian step by step. Topics such as indexing, stemming, querying and faceting techniques will be discussed with code samples. A working prototype of a search engine built with Xapian will be demonstrated in the end.\n\ndemo repo: https://github.com/jingle3276/imdb250\nslides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wQVQig5Vdj5unQAkQQI8mELmX2zqjQ6S9OqeQIDqgoc/edit#slide=id.p","level":"Beginner","stype":"Short Talk (20 Minutes)","slides":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm_M_rYDneM&index=1&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-27T13:30:00Z","duration":20}
