Recent advances with the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST), that runs the model, allow object oriented population generation. Evolutionary Computation, using the Python Inspyred library by Aaron Garrett, is a key element in MIST population generation. Recent developments allow easier introductions of variations in population generation to figure out fitness of unknown base assumptions. This is powerful in conjunction with High Performance Computing that allows testing multiple modeling assumptions in parallel.  \nPrevious work was presented in this and other venues: \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyvxiljc5vA \n* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD896WakR94","level":"Intermediate","stype":"Talk (50 Minutes)","slides":null,"video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htGRRjia-QQ&index=23&list=PL0MRiRrXAvRggP9ge7T_FCkYWZVAy_KEX","start":"2015-09-26T18:00:00Z","duration":50}
