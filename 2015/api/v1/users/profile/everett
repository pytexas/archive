Sometimes developer, sometimes advocate, and sometimes operator. In the past I've developed web applications, deployed OpenStack, taught workshops at conferences including SXSW and Gluecon, and presented at conferences including OSCON and the OpenStack Summits. I love spending time with my family. If it's calm outside, we launch rockets. If it's windy, we fly kites.","website":"http://blog.phymata.com","social_handles":[{"username":"everett_toews","site":"twitter"}]}
