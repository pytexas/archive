Here in Austin, I cofounded [PyLadiesATX](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-ATX/ \"PyLadiesATX\"), and last year I started [Austin Open Source GIS](http://www.meetup.com/atx-osg \"Austin Open Source GIS\"). I tend to use both those platforms pretty frequently to talk about and promote Python+GIS goodness.","website":"http://www.sarasafavi.com/","social_handles":[{"username":"sarasafavi","site":"github"},{"username":"sarasomewhere","site":"twitter"}]}
