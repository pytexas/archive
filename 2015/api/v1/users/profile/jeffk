Before joining Vox I ran the team that built HP's OpenStack/CloudFoundry PaaS offering.  Before that I co-managed a boutique web shop in Austin called Polycot from 2001 to 2010, where we did a bunch of interesting projects for interesting people.  After mainly building software in perl and PHP since the late 90's, I got into python in 2012, and have been building software with it nearly exclusively since.","website":"http://www.jeffkramer.com/","social_handles":[{"username":"jeffk","site":"github"},{"username":"jeffk","site":"twitter"}]}
