I received a PhD in physics in 2012 from Penn State University. My thesis was on the electronic properties of Dirac fermions. Although not proven (yet), when found in semiconductor devices, these particles may be useful for low-power consumption devices or even quantum computing. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas, I have continued to work on simulations and models for physical properties of materials. I have also become more active in the python community through involvement with the local pyladies chapter in Austin. ","website":null,"social_handles":[]}
