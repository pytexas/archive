I have always done front to back end web development, using CSS, Javascript, PHP, Ruby, and of course Python. I currently am a Software Engineer at Rackspace where I am working on internal tools using Python and Ruby. I started a chapter of Pyladies in San Antonio this year, and am diving deeper in to more community affairs. I enjoy mentoring as much as I do coding, but I am a gamer at heart.","website":null,"social_handles":[]}
