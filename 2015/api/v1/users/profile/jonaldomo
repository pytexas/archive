His workspace is full of unreleased projects in Python, Node, Ruby, IOS, Android and even Arduino.  Fortunately he partners up with a businessy person from time to time who helps drive the project to release.  Most recently this project was Fifth Quarter, a place that helps athletes find meaningful careers after college or a professional run.","website":"http://www.jmoses.co/","social_handles":[{"username":"mr_john_moses","site":"twitter"}]}
