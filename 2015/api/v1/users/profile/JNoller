{"username":"JNoller","name":"Jesse Noller","image":"/static/uploads/user_photos/2014-08/ArdurbZW_400x400.jpeg","biography":"I am a Python Programmer, father of two beautiful daughters, and am involved heavily in the Python community. I have server as chair for [PyCon US 2012 & 2013](http://us.pycon.org/ \"\") - the largest Python developer conference in the world. Additionally, I serve on the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/ \"\") board of directors as well as several committees geared towards community education and outreach.\r\n\r\nI work with community members and sponsors as much as possible to get them involved more in the community aspects of Python - either helping them draft [grant requests for the PSF](http://www.python.org/psf/grants/ \"\") or coaching them on where they can further help or contribute. I work with potential sponsors to help guide them where their contributions can do the most help for the PSF, community, PyCon, outreach groups such as PyLadies, etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I am a [Python core contributor](http://docs.python.org/devguide/ \"\") (ostensibly for the [multiprocessing](http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing \"\") module).\r\n\r\nI currently work for Rackspace as a Principle Engineer / Developer Advocate, my focus being on Open Source, Community & Developer Experience. I previously worked at [Nasuni Corporation](http://static.squarespace.com/static/50b76babe4b05c3cd8bab78a/50b7714de4b0192bc2226d52/50b772fde4b0192bc222822b/1354199805695/?format=original \"\"). Nothing I say on this site or blog is officially or unofficially endorsed by any past or present employer.\r\n\r\nI've been lucky to write the forewards to two books - \"[Dive into Python 3](http://books.google.com/books?id=ekrhtG-Hn5IC&lpg=PA167&ots=5SONsqvLrB&dq=dive%20into%20python%203%20forward&pg=PR13#v=onepage&q&f=false \"\")\", by Mark Pilgrim and \"[The Python Standard Library by Example](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9780132778633/foreword/xix \"\")\" by Doug Hellmann. I also got to write a fair amount for the now defunct Python Magazine.","website":"http://jessenoller.com/","social_handles":[{"username":"jnoller","site":"github"},{"username":"jessenoller","site":"twitter"}]}
