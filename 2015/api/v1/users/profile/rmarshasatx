I am particularly interested in the way Hadoop and other Big Data Apps can unlock the goldmine of information hidden in the mountains of data that IT accumulates and ignores daily. I believe the future in information security is to become more agile and responsive to better honor the threat, and big data operations will enable security analysts to better correlate a larger number of observations to more specifically identify threat agents.","website":"http://robertlmarshall.com/","social_handles":[{"username":"robert.marshall","site":"about.me"},{"username":"rmarshasatx","site":"github"},{"username":"rmarshasatx@gmail.com","site":"gplus"},{"username":"r_l_marsha","site":"twitter"}]}
