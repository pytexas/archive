# Sponsor Prospectus

Presenting PyTexas 2015, the 9th Annual Python Community Conference for the 
Texas Region. The purpose of PyTexas is to share Python-related knowledge and 
enthusiasm in the form of presentations, coding sprints, "teach me" sessions, 
and general networking among developers. It is run every year by volunteers 
from around the region.

In 2012, PyTexas received national recognition from former Python Software 
Foundation chair Steve Holden as a regional conference that deserves the Python 
community's support.

Please consider sponsoring PyTexas 2015 through a financial contribution to the
non-profit PyTexas Foundation. Your contribution helps the Texas-area Python
community build a better conference, while also providing a targeted marketing
and community outreach opportunity.

We have provided this prospectus for potential sponsors to find out more about 
the conference itself and available sponsorship opportunities. Our contact 
information is available immediately below if you have any questions.

## Why Sponsor?

As a sponsor, your funding assistance will serve three critical purposes:

1. Highlight your presence within the Texas Python community. You can use this to:
    - Recruit your next engineer
    - Drive adoption of your product
    - Simply show your support for the Texas Python community
1. Build a better PyTexas by enabling organizers to attract attendees with standard conference perks such as printed t-shirts, swag bags, catering, professional A/V, and more.
1. Help keep the cost of PyTexas low. PyTexas 2015 attendees will pay a modest 
    registration fee, and almost all of this fee will go to the rental of our 
    venue. Your sponsorship helps us keep this price reasonable for everyone 
    involved.

This is a great way to get the word out about your product.

### Location

Since 2011, PyTexas has been held at Texas A&M University in College Station. 
We have enjoyed significant support from the University’s College of Architecture and
Department of Computer Science, both of which use Python professionally.

PyTexas 2015 will return to College Station and the Texas A&M campus with the 
College of Architecture hosting the conference. As in 2014, the PyTexas 2015 
venue will be the newly renovated Memorial Student Center which features a 
16,000 square foot ballroom with state-of-the-art presentation technologies. 
This facility has been a hit in years past, and it has ample room for large 
presentations, small tutorial sessions, and sponsor presence.

## About the Python Language

Python is a general purpose, open source programming language popular for its 
elegant, high-level, and cross-platform design. It is protected and promoted by 
the [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf/). The PSF also aids
organizers of local conferences such as PyTexas with financial and logistical support.

Python has a wide range of practical uses, from simple scripts to large scale 
enterprise applications to high volume websites such as YouTube.

Python is used for system administration, web development, building GUI 
applications, scientific computing, game development, and as a "glue" language 
for systems integration, among other things. Python developers have many 
choices of runtime environments, including CPython, JVM (Jython), and .NET 
(IronPython).

See [http://www.python.org/about/quotes/](http://www.python.org/about/quotes/) to find out
how organizations around the world are using Python.
