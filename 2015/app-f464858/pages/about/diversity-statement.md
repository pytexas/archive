# Diversity Statement

Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment that 
invites participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, 
abilities, religions, and sexual orientation. PyTexas and its organizers 
support and endorse the Python Software Foundation's 
[diversity statement](http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/):

*"The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and 
encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, 
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to 
these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, 
and whatever your background, we welcome you."*

We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, 
and sponsors through our calls for proposals, other open submission processes, 
and through dialogue with the larger communities we serve.

Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience:

- Recommend appropriate speakers and/or program committee members to the 
    conference organizers
- Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message 
    that we are looking for a diverse speaker roster
- Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our 
    Call for Proposals conference phase
- Organize community-based public speaking trainings and practice events 
    (Ignite is one popular format)
- Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and 
    supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization 
    (send an email to PyTexas organizers)
- Share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision 
    (send an email to [PyTexas organizers](mailto:conference@pytexas.org))
- We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your 
    contributions to bringing balanced representation of the richness of our 
    collective human experience. Help us do this by following our
    [code of conduct](/2015/about/code-of-conduct).
