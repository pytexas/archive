# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why are early-bird tickets so much more this year?!

We provide early-bird tickets at a loss to drive attendance to the conference, and we lose money
in the process. In 2014, early-bird tickets were sold at a cost just over 50% of the conference's
final cost-per-head. In 2015, we're increasing the price of these tickets to offset some of that
loss. We believe $75 (or $95, for attendees with corporate backing) is still an *incredible* deal
for a professional programming conference, and we hope you agree.

## I want to volunteer or speak. Can I get a discount?

We do not currently have the funds to provide discounted or free attendance to volunteers or
speakers. Even our organizing team purchases tickets, because all funds are eventually used to
better the Texas Python community. For the same reasons, we do not generally pay speakers.

However, we do offer a limited number of scholarships for special cases. If you are facing financial
hardship, please email us at [conference@pytexas.org](mailto:conference.pytexas.org). Our goal is to ensure
that everyone who wants to attend PyTexas can do so.

## How much of my sponsorship or ticket price goes to the conference?

The short answer is: as much as is needed. Our goal each year is to put on the best
conference we can muster. In the event that we gather more funds from sponsorship or ticket
sales than we need for the conference, we simply roll the remainder over to the next year.
This helps us build a sustainable offering that Texas Python developers can rely on year
after year.

We aspire eventually to use excess funds to support outreach programs, day care for conference
attendees who are parents, scholarships for underprivileged attendees, and other worthy expenses
that further the goals of the PyTexas Foundation. We welcome your input on how we can best
assist the Texas Python community!

## My organization doesn't use Python. Why should I sponsor PyTexas?

There are several reasons to consider sponsoring the PyTexas conference even if your
organization doesn't currently use Python. First, you should consider using Python!
It's a remarkably flexible language that has established libraries for and applications
in web development, data science, science at large, and more.

Second, the trend in modern software development is toward **polyglot programming**. That is,
the best developers are competent in multiple languages and prefer to "pick the right tool for
the job." Polyglot programmers can bring to the table idioms and architectures that aren't
apparent to developers steeped in only one technology. Even if your organization primarily uses
[Go](http://golang.org/) or [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), you can increase your
recruiting reach and encourage internal innovation by hiring smart developers -- regardless
of what language they work in today. You can even make this part of your presence at the conference!
Feel free to submit a "X for Pythonistas" talk; we promise it will get due consideration.

## Is my contribution to PyTexas tax-deductible?

The PyTexas Foundation was organized as a Texas non-profit corporation in 2014 and received its
501(c)(3) recognition in early 2015. Although we cannot guarantee that your contribution to
PyTexas will be tax-deductible (we aren’t tax attorneys and just don’t know), you can rest
assured that any contributions to the organization will always be used to further the common
goals of the Texas Python community, and never for personal benefit.
