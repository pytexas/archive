# Code of Conduct

PyTexas is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for 
everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of 
conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including 
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not 
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave 
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary 
jokes are not appropriate for PyTexas.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a 
refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
