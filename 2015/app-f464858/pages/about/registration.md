# Registration Info

## Registration is open!

We've opened registration for PyTexas 2015. You can sign up over at [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pytexas-2015-registration-17162264796).

### Conference dates
The conference is scheduled to run September 25-27. Friday will be a tutorial day.

### Early Bird registration
The deadline for Early Bird registration is **July 19**. Sign up by then to save $20 off regular
registration. This is also the deadline for [talk proposals](/2015/speakers/call-for-proposals).

### Tutorial tickets
Tutorials don't cost any extra, but we **do** ask that you register for them if you're planning
on coming. This will help us with logistical planning. Just include a tutorial ticket when you're
purchasing your regular one.
