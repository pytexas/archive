# Call for Proposals

PyTexas 2015, the annual Python programming conference for Texas and the 
surrounding region, will take place Friday, September 25th, through Sunday, 
September 27th, on the Texas A&M campus in College Station, TX. This event is a 
great opportunity to meet with other Python folks, learn about what’s happening 
in the Python community, and spread the word about exciting projects using Python.

The PyTexas 2015 conference is now accepting proposals for talks to be 
presented at the conference. The PyTexas organizers would like to invite anyone 
interested to submit proposals for scheduled talks or tutorials.

### [Submit A Talk Form >](/2015/speakers/submit-talk)

Submission deadline is August 2nd.

## Talks

Talks may be either 20 or 50 minutes, though for exceptional proposals other 
talk durations may be considered.

Tutorials will be given in 3 hour blocks. If you would like a longer tutorial 
please break it up into 3 hour sessions and submit each tutorial separately.

Lightning talks will be 5 minutes and time will be strictly enforced.

If you have an idea for a presentation that doesn't fit the above guidelines, please submit it anyway. If it’s interesting enough, we’ll arrange our program around it.

## Tutorials

Tutorials will be presented during our tutorial day, Friday September 25th. 
Tutorials will be 3 hours in length, and should aim to provide a thorough 
in-depth treatment of a given topic. Preference will likely be given to 
proposals which aim to provide an introduction to a given topic.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Everyone! We want all kinds of proposals from people of all experience levels. Whether you’ve never given a talk at a conference, or have given dozens. Whether you just discovered Python, or are an old hand. Whether you're a programmer, designer, scientist, or music theorist (or whatever). We want to hear what you have to share!

### How do I submit a proposal?

It’s easy! Just submit your talk using the 
[speaker proposal form](/2015/speakers/submit-talk). You will be 
required to create an account and tell us a little about yourself in addition 
to the info about your talk.

### What should I give a talk on?

Your talk can be about anything related to the Python programming language or of interest to the Python community. Some specific areas that people have expressed interest in for talks this year include:

- General Python programming
- Web Applications
- GIS
- Scientific Computing
- Data Visualization

Some other ideas might be:

- How you used Python to solve a specific problem.
- Your favorite Python library
- How to broaden diversity within the Python community.
- Development tools for Python (or written in Python)
- etc. 

### Does PyTexas offer any financial support for speakers?

PyTexas does not currently offer financial support specifically for speakers. Since PyTexas is a community driven, not for profit conference, all speakers are required to purchase a ticket and provide accommodations for themselves. PyTexas does have a fund for financial assistance, and speakers are welcome to apply for those funds. However, the assistance funds are limited and are used mainly with general attendees in mind.
