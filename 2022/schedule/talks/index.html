Talk:
<a id="build-magic">Automating Build Tasks With Build-magic</a>
</h2>
<p>
Developers like writing software but loath building software. Amongst platform specific scripts, Makefiles, and CI pipelines, there’s no shortage of fragile, frustrating processes for building a software project. Build-magic aims to simplify builds with a declarative, repeatable tool for developers.

Talk:
<a id="data-types">Choosing the Right Data Types</a>
</h2>
<p>
So often, in Python, I’ve run up against the question of what type of data structure to use to express something. Does this need a tuple, a dict, a namedtuple, a dataclass, or something else? How do you select what to use, and what are the pros and cons? Let’s explore the options!

<h2>
Talk:
<a id="mozart">Coding and the Mozart Effect</a>
</h2>
<p>
Most developers code to music...some are even musicians themselves.  Is it possible to streamline workflow by adjusting how we listen to music and what music we listen to? Studies have shown that exposure to certain kinds of music can help to develop cognitive strength and improve performance of tasks.  This talk will explore those studies and show what sort of things can be done to improve the listeners environment and help people to create better code.

Talk:
<a id="microservices">Event-Driven Microservices with Flask and Apache Kafka</a>
</h2>
<p>
Implementing complex systems with microservices can be a great decision, but if we’re not careful we can end up with a distributed monolith. Let’s see how to avoid that by building lightweight, loosely coupled microservices with the Flask framework and Apache Kafka.

<a id="playwright">Awesome Web Testing with Playwright</a>
</h2>
<p>
Everybody gets frustrated when web apps are broken, but testing them thoroughly doesn't need to be a chore. Playwright, a new open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft, makes testing web apps fun! Playwright offers a slew of nifty features like automatic waiting, mobile emulation, and network interception. Plus, with isolated browser contexts, Playwright tests can set up *much* faster than traditional Web UI tests.
