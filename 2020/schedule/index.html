Talk:
Serverless Web Apps in Python
</h2>
<p>
Serverless technologies have a lot of people excited - in theory, they offer infinite scaling with no maintenance. After mostly seeing “hello-world on Lambda” tutorials, I was curious how it would work for a real application with a frontend and a database. This talk reviews my experience using AWS Lambda for full-stack web applications. If you’re familiar with the theory and want to know more about how it works in practice, you’re in the right place.

<h2>
Talk:
Practicality Beats Purity: The Zen of Python's Escape Hatch?
</h2>
<p>
The Zen of Python, the well known list of 20 Python aphorisms (of which only 19 are written down), contains a lot of prescriptive advice for what makes "Good" Python code… or it would, if one of them didn't give you permission to ignore the rest of them.

Focusing on but one of the 19 aphorisms, this talk explores the contradictions in the Zen of Python's advice, and how even with prescriptive rules, writing "Good" Python remains a subjective exercise.

DRYDock: Techniques for Not Repeating Yourself in Dockerfiles
</h2>
<p>
You know how Dockerfiles tend to get copied around from one project to the next? It’s messy and bug-prone. Well I figured out how to stop doing that, and start treating Dockerfiles like the actual infrastructure-as-code libraries that they are. So can you!

Everyday Design Patterns: Facade Pattern

Directly integrating dependencies into business logic couples our code to something we do not control. Changes made to upstream packages require us to update integration code across the project. This talk demonstrates how the Facade pattern can improve software design and simplify testing.
